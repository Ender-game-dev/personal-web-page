# personal-web-page
A repository that will hold my full web page... at some point ðŸ˜…
This is a project I am making on my own, my original idea was to make a web pagge that I would update overtime the more I learn.
That first idea could work for a while, but I'm pretty sure that at some point I would realize that some things I coded at the begining have a great impact on the present, and that doesn't sound good.
What I'm planning on doing is a mix between updating the original page while adding new sections or sub-pages as I keep learning.

The page is a work in progress, and everything you see is not finished.
With that said, enjoy of the page :D
