                <p>Hello, I'm Ender. I am a 20-years-old guy from Uruguay who enjoys videogames and likes to learn new things about pretty much any topic.</p>
                <p>I am currently studying front-end development (hence why this page is static) and am considering studying back-end after that.</p>
                <p>In terms of games: I like to play Minecraft, and Sky:CotL. I also enjoy many other games, but I would say those are the two I play the most.</p>
                <p>Between my hobbies, you can find:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reading: I'm currently reading "Murtagh" by Christopher Paolini</li>
                        <li>Learning the Thai language</li>
                        <li>Exploring topics I feel interesting, such as astronomy or biology</li>
                        <li>Drawing, but don't think I'm good at it, because I'm not. <span class="emoji" aria-label="Laugh emoji">ðŸ˜‚</span></li>
                    </ul>

                        Welcome to my page!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This page aims to showcase all my projects related to web development.<br>
                        All my projects can be found by clicking either the "Portfolio" or "Fun Projects" option I provided on the navigation tab.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are unsure on what to see first, click <a href="https://random.page" alt="Visit random page">here</a> and you will be sent to a random page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you want to know more about each option then keep reading as I will explain what you can expect on each one into detail.

                    <p>
                        Here you will be able to see all projects I have created with the goal of showcasing my best work, as well as my capabilities. 
                        This is the place where my most polished projects are, created with a professional vision in mind.

                        Fun Projects
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The name is quite straightforward.<br>
                        Here you'll find a variety of projects and pages I create just for fun or as experiments. Some of the experiments may have turned out better than expected, that's why they are there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this section, you may also find some projects I have done with friends as we challenge ourselves to create something while setting time limits or utilizing unfamiliar features that we may not be used to.<br>
                        Overall, this page contains the projects I think they were fun to make.
                    </p>

                <section class="nonProjectNav">

                        Non-project Options

                    <p>
                        You probably can tell that there are more options in the navigation bar, these options doesn't hold any of my projects, but instead serve a whole different purpose:
                    </p>
                    <p class="smallSubtitle">
                        Changelog
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Changelog option will have all major changes I make to this web page, it is a way for you to see how this page evolves overtime.<br>
                        While GitHub already maintains a detailed history of changes in the repository, I still wanted to make it a feature of my page.
                        In my opinion the Changelog section here offers a more accessible view.
                    </p>
                    <!--This break is here only while I don't style the page-->
                    <p class="smallSubtitle doubleMargin">
                        Dev Notes
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Dev Notes section will serve as a place for occasional reflections and thoughts. They are not necesarily related to the page, but is more of like a weird blog in some weird way.
                    </p>
                    <p class="subTitle">
                        Games
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You've reached this part on the page. Congratulations for reading all that, and thank you; now I know I didn't write all this in vain.<br>
                        If you read everything without skipping any part, you may have noticed in the "About Me" section that I like video games. Well... I'm not sure yet, but I would like to try coding some games into a web page. That section is more of a personal challenge to myself, and it will probably be empty for quite a while. But if I keep learning, maybe someday there may be something there. (Don't worry, I will let you know if I create something there in the Changelogs)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I say "Coding games into a web page," I mean that I'll start with basic games like Atari Breakout or TicTacToe. Additionally, if I'm successful at coding them and gain confidence in my skills, then it's likely I will try to code my own games.
                        As mentioned earlier, don't get too excited; it's still a long way off, but having that section on the navigation tab already will push me to make it happen someday. <span class="emoji" aria-label="Laugh Emoji">ðŸ˜‚</span>
